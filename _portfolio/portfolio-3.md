- Utilized Otsu's method to identify the track, while employing both vision techniques and an IMU to guide the robot
along the designated path. 
- Manually collected and labeled a dataset to train a CNN for recognizing graphic cards scattered along the roadside.
- Used an electromagnetic robotic arm to pick up and transport the cards to a designated location.
- Designed and developed PCBs for robot control. Conducted PCB tests and wiring arrangements for the robot.

These are some of the PCBs I designed and welded for the 19th National College Students' Smart Car Competition.

The first is used to actuate two DC motors and transmitting feedback signal from coders into proper connectors.

The second is the main control board used to install the MCU and connecting peripheral device through various connectors.

The following video clip shows how the IMU corrects the robots' orientation.
