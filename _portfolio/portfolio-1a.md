- Implemented an eye-in-hand vision system to detect blocks and estimate their 6-DoF poses.
- Determined optimal grasp orientations based on visual feedback and executed block picking and placing by integrating manually annotated path points.
- The open-source code is released at [https://github.com/langlang-02/teachur5_code/tree/final_project](https://github.com/langlang-02/teachur5_code/tree/final_project)
