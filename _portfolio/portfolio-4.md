- Implemented an advanced automatic routing system in C programming language that guides the snake to consume the maximum number of apples while avoiding collisions.
- Utilized the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to efficiently explore possible paths, ensuring the snake's survival and maximizing apple collection.
- Conducted extensive testing to refine the algorithm, improving the snake's decision-making process in real-time gameplay scenarios.
